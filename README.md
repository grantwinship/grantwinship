# hi there, i'm grant! :wave:
i'm an analytics engineer, primarily working with ELT and BI tools to deliver insight and impact to organizations of all sizes. i :heart: dbt, think SQL is actually great, and am currently :fire:'d up about the idea of headless BI and the metrics layer.

i'm interested in building out CLI tools, Vim plugins, and VSCode extensions to make data transformation and writing SQL into a more pleasurable developer experience :relieved:.

i also want to find time to re-sharpen my python :snake: analysis skills and at some point get more hands-on with data science and ML :robot:, but that's probably something for next year.
